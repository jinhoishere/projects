A project with a JSoup library.

## How to play

- After running `Main.java`, paste a URL that you want to start with. For example, you can give any URL of a Wikipedia page.
- It will ask you how many pages you want to play. This is the number of URLs you will find.
- You will see lists of the links present on that URL of page. Find one URL that leads to next page.
- Repeat this until you reach a page of the URL you gave.
- Your score will be how many links it took to reach your given URL. The smaller it is, the better.
